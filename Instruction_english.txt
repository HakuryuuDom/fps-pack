+ delete files listed in "to_delete.txt" (you can find those using search in the same folder)
*note - you'll have to re-delete em again after each game-recheck (happens after big updates)




about S1Engine:

if some important effects completely dissapear (blue\green glow on 1st boss of GLS, or lightning\balls on last of GLSH) that means those are purely made out of shiny spinning particles eating the most FPS and which were disabled via MaxParticleResize=3 line in S1Engine, set value to 4 or to 30 (if 4 doesn't work), so those would be shown again (with price being less FPS ofc)

if fullscreen stops working with it - edit resolution to your own in it ResX & ResY lines there using notepad

if textures becomes of rainbow\weird color - find and edit such line DirectionalLightmaps=true

if it crashes on launch - make sure you're not using mod for old character selection screen



also many UI mods can help you improve fps, especially lock-on cursor mod, damage numbers mods with scaling, and non-shaking bossbar ui mod - https://www.essentialmana.com/forums/#/discussion/7268/
